# Stellar-data-classification-using-supervised-learning

## Objective

This project is a Classification model comparison using various machine learning algorithms to classify the stars based on their spectral characteristics, which are Galaxies, Quasars (QSO) or Stars using the Dataset provided by the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey).

## Technologies

- Language: Python
- Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM


## Dataset

Data is extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17) and saved locally. Further explanation of the variables and features used can be found here.
